# BadassBeerInitLaunch
Changes, fixes and updates/enhancements for the initial launch of the Badass Beer website.




1. Age verification page. doesn't scale down correctly. I can't get the text "yes"/ "no" buttons to line up and scale well. On mobile it shows up at the top of the page and should fit to screen in a better way some how.

2. Navigation: splits around small screen size*. 
And mobile navigation is a bit messy. If there is anyway to clean that up by centering text, adjusting padding that would be awesome.
